# Blazor DataGrid - Prevent Enter Key Functionality in Multiline TextBox

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to prevent the default save action from being triggered when the Enter key is pressed while editing a multiline text box in the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid. In multiline editing scenarios, users often expect the Enter key to insert a new line instead of completing the edit operation. The sample shows how the Grid editing experience can be customized to avoid unintended save operations and provide a more natural text-entry workflow.
